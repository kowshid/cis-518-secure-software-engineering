esp: stack pointer
ebp: base pointer (aka frame pointer)
eip: instruction pointer

Actions taken during function call and return in a "conventional" function call:
********************************************************************************

A caller is a function that calls another function; a callee is a function that was called.

1. The caller performs the following actions:

    Caller pushes the arguments on stack in callee's stack frame in reverse order. This moves esp.

    Caller pushes the address of the next instruction to execute in the caller 
    (i.e. the current value of eip) on the stack in callee's stack frame. This moves esp.
    
    Control jumps to the called function.

2.  The callee performs the following actions in its "prologue"

    Push the current value of ebp on the stack (to save caller's frame pointer).
    This instruction moves esp.     // pushl   %ebp
    
    Set ebp register to the current value of esp (sets callee's frame pointer) // movl %esp, %ebp

    Allocate space on stack for callee's local variables.   // subl %N, %esp
    This instruction moves esp.
    
3.  The callee executes the statements in the function body.

4.  The callee performs the following actions in its "epilogue"
    
    Copy ebp into esp (to release space used for local variables) // movl %ebp, %esp
    
    Pop caller's frame pointer into ebp. This moves esp.    // popl  %ebp
    
    Pop return address from the stack and jump to it. This moves esp.
    
5.  The caller pops the arguments off the stack. This moves esp.
